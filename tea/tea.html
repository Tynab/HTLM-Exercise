            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea
            plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan)
            and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa
            to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
            equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are
            arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds
            (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are
            ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage. Coffee is a brewed drink prepared
